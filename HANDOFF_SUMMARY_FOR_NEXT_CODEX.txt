[2026-02-15T14:19:34+08:00] owner=codex major_action: created reusable repo packaging OpenClaw+proxy+Discord and Codex Discord relay
[2026-02-15T14:19:34+08:00] major_action: added bootstrap.sh + scripts for install/config/cron
[2026-02-15T14:19:34+08:00] major_action: added portable watchdog scripts under system/ (support override env vars)
[2026-02-15T14:24:02+08:00] owner=codex major_action: expanded README with one-shot bootstrap runbook + security notes
[2026-02-16T13:30:17+08:00] (codex) Task start: audit toolkit docs in /root/openclaw-codex-discord-kit against current live deployment (/usr/local/bin + /root/codex-discord-relay) and update documentation. Run/log paths to inspect: /root/.codex-discord-relay/relay.log, /root/.codex-discord-relay/sessions.json, /root/.codex-discord-relay/instances/*/relay.log.
[2026-02-16T13:32:16+08:00] (codex) Major action: audited live deployment vs repo docs.
- Audited scripts: /usr/local/bin/codex-discord-relay-ensure.sh, /usr/local/bin/codex-discord-relay-ensure-multi.sh, /usr/local/bin/codex-discord-relayctl, /usr/local/bin/codex-discord-relay-multictl, /usr/local/bin/openclaw-gateway-ensure.sh
- Audited runtime paths/logs: /root/.codex-discord-relay/relay.log, /root/.codex-discord-relay/sessions.json, /root/.codex-discord-relay/instances.d/alpha.env.example
- Observed cron points to ensure-multi: @reboot + */1 * * * * /usr/local/bin/codex-discord-relay-ensure-multi.sh
[2026-02-16T13:32:32+08:00] (codex) Major action: documentation updated to match current deployment behavior and troubleshooting.
- Updated: /root/openclaw-codex-discord-kit/README.md
- Updated: /root/openclaw-codex-discord-kit/codex-discord-relay/README.md
- Added explicit docs for single-instance vs multi-instance operations, state paths, progress reporting env vars, and relay stall triage.
[2026-02-16T13:32:32+08:00] (codex) Task end: doc refresh complete.
Current run state:
- Relay process observed active: /root/codex-discord-relay/relay.js (default instance)
- Cron observed using multi ensure: /usr/local/bin/codex-discord-relay-ensure-multi.sh
- Runtime logs/state paths referenced in docs: /root/.codex-discord-relay/relay.log, /root/.codex-discord-relay/sessions.json, /root/.codex-discord-relay/instances/*/relay.log
Next steps:
- Optional: port multi-instance scripts into toolkit installer scripts so fresh bootstrap installs match live operations.
[2026-02-16T13:33:48+08:00] (codex) Task start: design proposal only (no file edits) for periodic toolkit update automation + reusable skill for periodic mechanistic services.
[2026-02-16T13:37:08+08:00] (codex) Task end (design phase): prepared recommended architecture: systemd timer-based auto-update pipeline (proxy-aware, ff-only pull, deploy + verify, logging/lock) and reusable skill scaffold for generic periodic mechanistic jobs. Awaiting user approval before implementation.
[2026-02-16T13:41:39+08:00] (codex) Task start: implement periodic auto-update service (daily) and align toolkit installer with live multi-instance relay operations. Objective includes adding reusable skill for periodic mechanistic services.
[2026-02-16T13:47:30+08:00] (codex) Major action: implemented toolkit-side automation + deployment alignment.
- Added installer: /root/openclaw-codex-discord-kit/scripts/install_openclaw_kit_autoupdate.sh
- Added updater runner: /root/openclaw-codex-discord-kit/system/openclaw-kit-autoupdate.sh
- Added unit templates: /root/openclaw-codex-discord-kit/system/openclaw-kit-autoupdate.service + .timer
- Added multi relay wrappers to repo: /root/openclaw-codex-discord-kit/system/codex-discord-relay-ensure-multi.sh and codex-discord-relay-multictl
- Updated bootstrap/install scripts to deploy multi wrappers and auto-update installer.
- Updated config/docs for auto-update controls and fallback behavior.

[2026-02-16T13:47:30+08:00] (codex) Major action: deployed changes on this host.
- Installed: /usr/local/bin/openclaw-kit-autoupdate.sh, /usr/local/bin/codex-discord-relay-ensure-multi.sh, /usr/local/bin/codex-discord-relay-multictl
- Since systemd is unavailable in this environment, installer activated cron fallback:
  /etc/cron.d/openclaw-kit-autoupdate -> `17 3 * * * root /usr/local/bin/openclaw-kit-autoupdate.sh`
- Manual test run executed: /usr/local/bin/openclaw-kit-autoupdate.sh
  result: skipped update due to dirty repo safety check.
- Run/log paths: /var/log/openclaw-kit-autoupdate.log, /root/.codex-discord-relay/relay.log, /root/.codex-discord-relay/sessions.json.
[2026-02-16T13:47:30+08:00] (codex) Task end: implementation complete.
Current run state:
- Relay watchdog cron active: @reboot + */1 ensure-multi
- Auto-update scheduler active via cron fallback (systemd unavailable): /etc/cron.d/openclaw-kit-autoupdate
Next steps:
- Optional: install/enable systemd init on host to use timer unit directly instead of cron fallback.
- Optional: commit toolkit repo changes and keep repo clean so auto-update can fast-forward pull.
[2026-02-16T13:47:55+08:00] (codex) Failure+fix: install_codex_discord_relay.sh initially failed (`rsync: command not found`). Added fallback copy path (remove app files except node_modules, then `cp -a`) so deployment works on minimal hosts without rsync.
[2026-02-16T13:48:58+08:00] (codex) Verification: all updated scripts pass `bash -n` syntax checks.
- Re-ran auto-update installer; confirmed fallback cron config persisted:
  /etc/cron.d/openclaw-kit-autoupdate => `17 3 * * * root /usr/local/bin/openclaw-kit-autoupdate.sh`
- Relay run state check: `/usr/local/bin/codex-discord-relay-multictl list` reports default instance running.
[2026-02-16T13:56:41+08:00] (codex) Task start: user requested commit of current toolkit changes so repo is clean for future auto-update runs (ff-only). Objective: validate, stage relevant files, create commit on main.
[2026-02-16T13:57:40+08:00] (codex) Major action: committed toolkit changes to git.
- Commit: edcbde3
- Message: Add multi-instance relay deploy + periodic toolkit auto-update
- Includes: multi-instance relay installer wrappers, systemd+cron-fallback autoupdate pipeline, bootstrap wiring, config/docs updates, and prior relay/docs enhancements in codex-discord-relay/*.

[2026-02-16T13:57:40+08:00] (codex) Verification:
- `git status --short --branch` => clean tree, main is ahead of origin by 1 commit.
- `/usr/local/bin/openclaw-kit-autoupdate.sh` manual run succeeded and logged deployment reconciliation to /var/log/openclaw-kit-autoupdate.log.
- Active schedules: user crontab ensure-multi entries; /etc/cron.d/openclaw-kit-autoupdate fallback daily schedule.

[2026-02-16T13:57:40+08:00] (codex) Task end: repo dirty state resolved (committed). Next step for cross-host ff-only updates: push commit `edcbde3` to origin/main.
[2026-02-16T14:03:42+08:00] (codex) Task start: user requested pushing local commit edcbde3 to origin/main and clarification about skill scope (local vs account-level).
[2026-02-16T14:04:06+08:00] (codex) Major action: pushed commit `edcbde3` to remote.
- Remote: origin (https://github.com/MachengShen/openclaw-codex-discord-kit.git)
- Ref update: main 0dcfa73 -> edcbde3
- Verification: `git status --short --branch` now shows `main...origin/main` (no ahead/behind).

[2026-02-16T14:04:06+08:00] (codex) Task end: push complete. Remaining local modification is only this HANDOFF log append.
[2026-02-16T14:14:30+08:00] (codex) Task start: package custom local Codex skills into toolkit repo with one-command installer for new machines; optionally attempt repository rename to reflect skills packaging.
[2026-02-16T14:13:00+08:00] (codex) Major action: packaged custom skills into toolkit repo for cross-machine reuse.
- Added bundle root: /root/openclaw-codex-discord-kit/packaged-skills
- Bundled skills:
  - codex-discord-relay-stuck-check
  - discord-image-upload
  - openclaw-media-send
  - periodic-mechanistic-service
- Added installer: /root/openclaw-codex-discord-kit/scripts/install_packaged_skills.sh
- Bootstrap now installs packaged skills when OPENCLAW_INSTALL_PACKAGED_SKILLS=true.

[2026-02-16T14:13:00+08:00] (codex) Major action: repository renamed on GitHub via gh CLI.
- Old: MachengShen/openclaw-codex-discord-kit
- New: MachengShen/openclaw-codex-discord-skills-kit
- Updated local origin URL accordingly.

[2026-02-16T14:13:00+08:00] (codex) Major action: improved autoupdate fallback for non-systemd hosts.
- /etc/cron.d/openclaw-kit-autoupdate now includes explicit env vars for repo/proxy/log path, so renamed/relocated repo paths continue to work.
[2026-02-16T14:13:30+08:00] (codex) Task end: packaged-skills + repo rename complete.
- Commit pushed: a702426 (Bundle custom skills and add one-command skills installer)
- GitHub repo canonical name now: MachengShen/openclaw-codex-discord-skills-kit
- Local origin URL updated to new repo URL.
- Auto-update validation log path: /var/log/openclaw-kit-autoupdate.log
- Runtime relay paths referenced/validated: /root/.codex-discord-relay/relay.log, /root/.codex-discord-relay/sessions.json
- Scheduler state on this host: /etc/cron.d/openclaw-kit-autoupdate (systemd unavailable), plus user crontab ensure-multi watchdog entries.

[2026-02-16 21:04:12 CST +0800] Owner: Codex (GPT-5) | Objective: restore OpenClaw + codex/Claude Discord responsiveness; diagnose no-response outage.
- Context: user reports both OpenClaw and codex/Claude agent do not respond to Discord messages.
- Initial evidence: `openclaw gateway health` => gateway closed 1006/no reason; `openclaw status` => gateway unreachable ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:18789; relay instance default running pid 15591.
- Active run/log paths: /root/.codex-discord-relay/relay.log ; /tmp/openclaw/openclaw-2026-02-16.log ; /root/openclaw-codex-discord-skills-kit/system/openclaw-gateway-ensure.sh ; /usr/local/bin/openclaw-gateway-ensure.sh.
- Training state: N/A (no training job active; epoch/metrics not applicable).
[2026-02-16 21:06:12 CST +0800] Owner: Codex (GPT-5) | Major actions: root-cause fix + service recovery.
- Root cause confirmed from logs: watchdog restart path was invoking `openclaw` under `/usr/bin/node` v10 due bad NVM bin discovery, causing `openclaw.mjs` parse crash (`SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier`) and prior NODE_OPTIONS incompat errors; gateway remained down (`gateway closed 1006`).
- Code change: patched `/root/openclaw-codex-discord-skills-kit/system/openclaw-gateway-ensure.sh` line for NVM dir detection (`ls -d1 /root/.nvm/versions/node/v*/bin`), preserving Node 24 in PATH.
- Deployment: reinstalled script to `/usr/local/bin/openclaw-gateway-ensure.sh` via `scripts/install_openclaw_gateway_watchdog.sh`.
- Recovery run: executed `/usr/local/bin/openclaw-gateway-ensure.sh` manually; `gateway-autostart.log` now records `[2026-02-16T21:05:38+08:00] gateway start verified`.
- Health now: `openclaw gateway health` => `OK` + `Discord: ok`; `openclaw status` => gateway reachable; `codex-discord-relay-multictl start default` => running pid 19594.
- Proxy/env check: verified live env on both gateway and relay includes proxy keys (`HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY/ALL_PROXY/DISCORD_GATEWAY_PROXY`) redacted.
- Run/log paths: `/root/.openclaw/log/gateway-autostart.log`, `/root/.openclaw/log/manual-gateway.log`, `/tmp/openclaw/openclaw-2026-02-16.log`, `/root/.codex-discord-relay/relay.log`.
- Training state: N/A (no training job active; epoch/metrics not applicable).

[2026-02-16 21:06:21 CST +0800] Owner: Codex (GPT-5) | Task end summary.
- Changed files this task: `/root/openclaw-codex-discord-skills-kit/system/openclaw-gateway-ensure.sh` and this handoff log.
- Current run state: OpenClaw gateway running (`openclaw-gateway` pid 19163), relay default running (`relay.js` pid 19594), cron watchdogs still installed.
- Recommended immediate user check: send one test message to each bot in Discord (mention in guild or thread per relay config) to validate end-to-end response path.
[2026-02-16 21:21:10 CST +0800] Owner: Codex (GPT-5) | Objective: diagnose DM stall where codex_agent shows "Running Claude" without response.
- Trigger: user reports DM to codex_agent always stuck at running Claude.
- Initial evidence: relay process up (`pid 19974`), openclaw healthy, but relay spawned claude child (`pid 25516`, parent 19974, long-running).
- Session mapping file: `/root/.codex-discord-relay/sessions.json` includes DM key `dm:868020619499937792` with prior session_id `019c6546-802d-7ad0-8699-8a95bc5e4239`.
- Active run/log paths: `/root/.codex-discord-relay/relay.log`, `/root/codex-discord-relay/relay.js`, `/root/.codex-discord-relay/sessions.json`.
- Training state: N/A (no training job active; epoch/metrics not applicable).
[2026-02-16 21:26:18 CST +0800] Owner: Codex (GPT-5) | Major actions: Claude-DM stall remediation.
- Updated runtime env `/root/.codex-discord-relay.env`: set `CLAUDE_PERMISSION_MODE=acceptEdits` (safe for root-run relay).
- Patched relay code in live app and toolkit copy:
  - `/root/codex-discord-relay/relay.js`
  - `/root/openclaw-codex-discord-skills-kit/codex-discord-relay/relay.js`
  Added `resolveClaudePermissionMode()` fallback (root -> `acceptEdits`) and startup warning when implicit fallback is used.
- Cleared stuck DM resume state in `/root/.codex-discord-relay/sessions.json` for `dm:868020619499937792` (`threadId=null`) and restarted relay.
- Restart sequence: `codex-discord-relay-multictl stop/start default`; final running pid observed `28833`.
- Validation: local Claude smoke with explicit acceptEdits succeeded (`result: relay-ready`) proving proxy+auth+model path is functional.
- Run/log paths: `/root/.codex-discord-relay/relay.log`, `/root/.codex-discord-relay/sessions.json`, `/root/codex-discord-relay/relay.js`, `/root/openclaw-codex-discord-skills-kit/codex-discord-relay/relay.js`.
- Training state: N/A (no training job active; epoch/metrics not applicable).

[2026-02-16 21:26:32 CST +0800] Owner: Codex (GPT-5) | Task end summary.
- Current run state: OpenClaw gateway healthy; codex-discord-relay default instance running; no active relay-owned `claude` child at verification snapshot.
- User-facing expectation: DM should no longer stay on perpetual "Running Claude..." due stale resume + root permission-mode mismatch.
- Next check: ask user to send a fresh DM prompt; if issue persists capture exact timestamp and I can trace that single run in relay/Claude debug logs.
[2026-02-16 21:31:55 CST +0800] Owner: Codex (GPT-5) | Major actions: DM-stall hardening + observability.
- Root-cause hypothesis from live evidence: DM run may stall before agent execution due awaited `message.channel.sendTyping()` (Discord REST/proxy can hang), leaving pending message at "Running Claude..." with no claude child visible.
- Code changes (live + toolkit copy):
  - `/root/codex-discord-relay/relay.js`
  - `/root/openclaw-codex-discord-skills-kit/codex-discord-relay/relay.js`
  Added runtime event logging (`relay-runtime` JSON lines) and changed typing call to non-blocking (`void sendTyping().catch(...)`) so typing cannot block run start.
  Added robust error fallback: if pending-message edit fails, relay attempts `sendLongReply` with error body.
- Verified syntax: `node --check` passes for both relay files.
- Restarted relay ensure/start; current default relay running pid `32135`.
- Persistent DM state remains reset for user DM key: `/root/.codex-discord-relay/sessions.json` => `dm:868020619499937792.threadId = null`.
- Run/log paths: `/root/.codex-discord-relay/relay.log`, `/root/.claude/debug/*.txt`, `/root/codex-discord-relay/relay.js`.
- Training state: N/A (no training job active; epoch/metrics not applicable).
[2026-02-16 21:32:35 CST +0800] Owner: Codex (GPT-5) | Task end state for this turn.
- Relay run state: default instance running pid `32402` (watchdog-managed), OpenClaw gateway still healthy.
- Pending verification from user: send fresh DM `/status` then short prompt to confirm no more stuck "Running Claude...".
- If recurrence: relay now emits `relay-runtime` JSON events in `/root/.codex-discord-relay/relay.log` for queued/start/done/failure/edit-failure phases to pinpoint exact stall boundary.

- Relay stability check over ~70s: PID remained constant (`32402` -> `32402`), instance status remained running.
- Confirms watchdog is not flapping post-patch; remaining validation is live DM message path with new runtime logs.

- Repo verification pass completed for handoff spec in /root/openclaw-codex-discord-skills-kit.
- Confirmed and fixed two concrete issues:
  1) tail-truncation bug in context injection (newest log entries could be dropped).
  2) Codex resume arg parse failure (`unexpected argument --sandbox`) after previous arg-order refactor.
- Patched files:

- Outcome: unfinished modification was taken over and completed to a runnable state.
- Current behavior:
  - Context multi-spec loading and workdir-relative resolution remain enabled.
  - /context and /context reload remain implemented.
  - resume invocation no longer fails on `--sandbox` parser error for current codex-cli.
  - search toggle now uses config override (`-c features.web_search_request=true`) instead of unsupported `--search`.
- Next operator check (Discord-side):
  1) /workdir into a repo containing docs/WORKING_MEMORY.md and HANDOFF_LOG.md
  2) send one message, then /context, then /context reload and send again
  3) confirm latest handoff tail is visible after reload

- Objective: diagnose Discord relay sandbox failure report (`Sandbox(LandlockRestrict)`) and restore Codex relay to no-approval YOLO mode.
- Initial evidence:
  - /root/.codex-discord-relay.env has `CODEX_SANDBOX=workspace-write` and `CODEX_APPROVAL=never`.
  - Relay is running (`codex-discord-relay-multictl status all`), failure is runtime sandbox restriction, not relay-down.

[2026-02-17T20:23:40+08:00] owner=codex objective=restore relay YOLO mode (major action)
- Root-cause evidence captured:
  - Live relay env had `CODEX_SANDBOX=workspace-write` in `/root/.codex-discord-relay.env`.
  - User-observed failure text (`Sandbox(LandlockRestrict)`) is consistent with command execution under restricted sandbox mode.
  - Relay process/health was otherwise normal (not a relay-down incident).
- Runtime configuration changes applied:
  - `/root/.codex-discord-relay.env`: `CODEX_SANDBOX=danger-full-access`, `CODEX_APPROVAL=never`
  - `/root/.codex-discord-relay/instances.d/claude.env`: `CODEX_SANDBOX=danger-full-access`, `CODEX_APPROVAL=never` (kept consistent)
- Relay restart + verification:
  - `codex-discord-relay-multictl start all`
  - Running PIDs: default=4490, claude=4521
  - `/proc/<pid>/environ` confirms `CODEX_SANDBOX=danger-full-access` for running relay processes.
- Command-path probe (post-change):
  - `codex exec --sandbox danger-full-access resume <thread_id> ... --json "Run one shell command: pwd"`
  - Result: command execution succeeded (`/root`), no sandbox arg errors, no Landlock error.
