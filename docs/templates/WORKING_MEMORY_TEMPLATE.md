## Objective
- One paragraph: what are we trying to achieve / prove?

## Active Hypotheses (max 3)
- H1: <one falsifiable sentence>
  - Status: untested | inconclusive | supported | weakened | falsified
  - Evidence FOR: <metric + n + condition> — <artifact path / run_id>
  - Evidence AGAINST: <metric + n + condition> — <artifact path / run_id>
  - Falsifier: <what would refute it?>
  - Next discriminating test: <one runnable command; what changes status?>

## Current Best Result (verified only)
- Metric: <name>=<value> ± <std> (n=<seeds/trials>, condition=<eval setup>)
- Artifact: <path>
- Run: <run_id>  Commit: <hash>
- Notes: <one line>

## Known Failure Modes / Limits
- Bullet list; link to negative results entries.

## Running Jobs / Pending Tasks (if any)
- job_id: ... (log path)
- task_id: ...

## Next Experiment (runnable)
```bash
# exact command
```
Expected:
- Success signature:
- Failure signature:
- Stop criteria:

## Open Questions (ranked)
1. <question> (why it blocks progress)
2. ...
